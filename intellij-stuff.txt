# intellij is a bloated program that's convenient for quick imports and debugging...

# How to set up projects so you don't need one intellij window per repo:
#
# Suppose you have a dir D with two repos p,r. Do
# 1. File -> New -> New Project -> Empty project -> enter D and its path
# 2. File -> New -> Module from existing sources -> choose repo
#      -> Import module from external model
#
# That's it. (Tested with 2021.2.3 Community Edition)
